# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update with your production URLs

# Primary API Base URL (shared base URL for all services)
# This is used for both requirements analysis and test plan generation
# Set this if all services are behind the same base URL
VITE_API_BASE=https://api.yourdomain.com

# OR use separate URLs for each service:

# Test Plan API Base URL (ai-testing-agent backend - port 5050)
# This is the main backend service for authentication, test plan generation, etc.
VITE_TEST_PLAN_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Requirements Analysis API Base URL (ai-sr-business-req-analyst - port 8000)
# This is used by the requirements analysis service
# Note: Currently uses VITE_API_BASE, but can be configured separately if needed
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://requirements-api.yourdomain.com

# Development defaults (used if no env vars are set):
# - VITE_API_BASE defaults to http://localhost:8000 (requirements service)
# - VITE_TEST_PLAN_API_BASE_URL defaults to http://localhost:5050 (testing agent)

# For Production:
# 1. Set VITE_API_BASE to your production API URL
# 2. Or set VITE_TEST_PLAN_API_BASE_URL if using separate URLs
# 3. Rebuild the frontend: npm run build
# 4. The env vars are embedded at build time, so they must be set before building
