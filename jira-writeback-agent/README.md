# Jira Write-Back Agent

This agent performs deterministic Jira write-back operations only.

It rewrites existing Jira issues using pre-approved, scope-locked outputs
from upstream agents.

This agent:
- Never generates content
- Never uses AI or heuristics
- Never creates Jira issues
- Never modifies Jira workflows

All Jira mutations require explicit approval and are fully audited.
